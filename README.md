# CPPMicroProj-Agriculture
A micro-project written in C++ using SFML to emulate a luck-based card game.

# Goal
Gain points by using ressource and tool cards to achieve a defined quota, without exceding a cost.

# Game
5 cards are drawn initially, and each time a card is used, a new card is drawn. Each card has a defined number of dices thrown when the card is used, gaining an amount of point equal to the sum of the dices numbers. Tool cards can help the player to achieve better score.
